# My Process

To complete this assignment, 
<li>I first used a <a href="https://youtu.be/E2d91v1Twcc">youtube video</a> to help me get acquainted with using git with R.</li>
<li>Then I created a new repository from the github website and configured my git settings in R.</li>
<li>Then I used the links on the hw description page to learn how to use bullets, links, images, headers, bold, and italics.</li>
<li>I worked almost entirely in RStudio.</li>
<li>I relied heavily on the raw html that was linked on the assignment page.</li>
<li>I found the assignment not to difficult. I did have issues with R project actually uploading to github. Overall it has been a good introductory assignment.</li>
